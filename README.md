# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, a lot, the topics were able to cover a lot of what I was lost on or wasn't sure of to do in the project. More specifically when it came to using props within the DOM of the project.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time, I would have loved to implement more stretch features such as the favorite or watched list. Other than that I feel everythign went fine.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I feel that Im getting a lot more comfortable with CSS and being able to handle more interactivity between the elements went well. What didnt go as planned was the calling of the API, especially after all of the different types of calls to it was a little hard to naviagate. I would like to still play around more with the styling still.

### Open-source libraries used
